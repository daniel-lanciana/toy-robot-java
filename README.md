==============

REA toy robot exercise...now in Java!

* Java 8
* Exerimenting with Spring Boot for setup
* Enums instead of Array patch
* JUnit4 tests. Tried GroovyTests, but no IDE support.
* Mockito for mocks (added dependency)
* Commit TDD to Git without implementation loaded with errors = feels bad to commit...stub/scaffolding
* Unit tests, integration tests

* No global properties file
* No web application
* No explore for spec-type TDD options
* No error messages returned, just ignored (for convenience, as per brief)
* No Hamcrest
* Comments
